            <p>Jogbani: The water came at night. It slithered down the mountainside in Nepal, crashed through the old sugar mill on the India border, and swept through Rajendra Yadav’s earthen hut, the first home in the the clutch of huts, houses, and gated mansions that make up this border settlement in north Bihar.</p>

            <p>In the early hours of morning on August 12, Jogbani was under 8 feet of water, but Yadav was calm. </p>

            <p>“I’m an old man, I’ve seen a flood before,” he told Deepak, his middle-aged son. “The water will recede.” And when it did, Yadav left the high ground where his family had taken sanctuary to lay down on the damp charpai in his home. </p>

            <p>“A few hours later, another wave of water suddenly came down from Nepal,” Deepak recalled two weeks later, “I looked back, my father and my house were gone.”</p>

            <p>The flood stayed for 2 days in Jogbani, claiming at least 16 lives.When the waters finally left, residents found the corpses caught in fences, shrubs and canals. Some, like Memonisha Khatoon and her teenaged daughters Fareeda and Gulzari, still held fast to each other in one final, fatal, embrace.</p>

            <p>For the rest of north Bihar, the deluge was just beginning. Over the next fortnight, 514 lives were lost and 17 million people were displaced or inundated across 21 districts in Bihar’s worst flood since 2008.</p>

            <p>“Even our grandparents haven’t seen floods like this,” said Amar Kumar, a resident of Halhaliya, “We don’t understand the water anymore.” </p>
            *** 
            <p>Bihar’s floods have claimed 9500 lives since the government started publishing the numbers in 1979. People die every year: some years like 1992, the deaths are as low as 4, and bad years like 2007, the casualties rise to as high as 1287. </p>

            <p>Till recently, the causes were well established and endlessly debated.</p>

            <p>“Bihar is like a shallow bowl which fills up with water in the rainy season,” said Dinesh Kumar Mishra, a civil engineer who has written several books on Bihar’s annual floods. The state is situated on the floodplains of the river Ganga, its tributaries, and over 200 streams that flow from the foothills of Nepal. “In the rainy season, the bowl spills, the rivers flood their banks and replenish and rejuvenate the plains.”</p>

            <p>The solution - to build earthen embankments to hem in the river - has been dogged by controversy since it began in1800s at the cusp of the colonial period and continues to this day. Today, Bihar has over 3000 km of embankment, which proponents say, have largely contained the fury of the floods and opened up vast tracts of land to agricultural and commerce. </p>

            <p>Critics, like Mishra, contend that the embankments cast a phenomenon, as natural as the ebb and flow of the tides as a “problem” that can somehow be “solved” by civil engineering.  The cure, Mishra contends, is worsening the disease: Bihar’s rivers carry lots of fertile sediment which is spreads over a large area when the river floods. When contained between embankments, this sediment deposits along the river bed.</p>

            <p>“This raises the level of the river, so you make taller embankments, which are less stable,” said Mishra. In 2008 for instance, the Kosi river breached its embankment, triggering a flood that killing 489 people in two adjoining districts of Supaul and Madhepura, and 626 people across the state.
            “Its like you have a cat, which you turn it into a tiger. Then you don’t know how to fight the tiger.”</p>

            <p>But even as the embankment debate continues, the 2017 flood suggests that Bihar’s flood is changing - possibly due to changing monsoon patterns across the Indian subcontinent. Jogbani, the settlement on the Nepal border, is in Araria - a district that is not considered flood-prone by the government, but suffered the most casualties this year.</p>

            <p>Whilst researching the floods of 1987, Mishra found that communities in flood-prone areas had a rich vocabulary to describe the inundation. The word boah, for instance, described a flood in which river waters reach the threshold of village homes, humma, denotes a flood where the level of the water rises till the windows, while saah describes a flood in which the water touches the roof. </p>

            <p>“It used to be very rare that a person would witness a saah more than once in a lifetime,” Mishra said. This is no longer the case. Intense floods, involving huge volumes of water, are increasingly common.</p>

            <p>The moods of the water as documented in village ritual, Mishra agreed, are becoming harder to understand.</p>

            <section class="copy">
            <p>On July 18 this year, when Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar held a video-conference with district collectors to discuss the onset of the monsoon, his bureaucrats were prepared for a drought. It had been a long, hot summer and many districts were facing a severe water shortage.</p>

            <p>But three weeks later, the Indian Meteorological Department issued a heavy rainfall alert for eastern India and parts of Bihar on August 10, 11, and 12. NASA satellite imagery from the time, showed a giant purple patch (denoting rainfall in access of 175 mm over 24 hours) stretched out across eastern India.</p>

            <p>“When we saw the warning, we knew something was going to happen,” said Principal Secretary Pratyaya Amrit, who oversaw flood mitigation and relief efforts, “We had an emergency meeting with IMD, but the alert was for all of Bihar. They could not point to specific places.”</p>

            <p>So the government sought to deploy its resources to known trouble-spots like the districts of Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, and Madhepura. On August 11, Amrit spoke individually with the district collectors of several flood-prone regions. He spoke with the collector at Araria as well, but admitted they didn’t expect the district was not a priority.</p>

            <p>“On the 11th night, Araria was reporting a rainfall deficit of 39%,” he said,  “If anything, people were looking forward to rain.”</p>

            <p>On August 12th however, Araria received TKTK mm of rainfall; another TKTK followed on the 13th, and TKTK on the 14th. Southern Nepal - which shares a border with Araria - was inundated as well, resulting in what experts are now calling a “flash-flood.”</p>

            <p>“Climate change has changed rainfall patterns,” said Prof Ramakar Jha, a flood expert at the National Institute of Technology in Patna, explaining that the same amount of rainfall occurs in comparatively fewer rainy days. “So a large amount of water falls in a very short time interval, causing flash floods.”</p>

            <p>This has left disaster management officials struggling to recalibrate their plans.</p>
            </section>
            ***
            <section class="copy">
            <p>Twenty four hours into the flood, the residences of Araria’s district collector and superintendent of police were under eight feet of water. The electricity and cellphone networks collapsed, roads were washed out and culverts broke, snapping all links with the rest of the state.</p>

            <p>State emergency officials in Patna said they “lost Araria for 16 hours”, making it impossible to coordinate relief efforts.</p>

            <p>In Araria town, it was impossible to pinpoint exactly where the water was coming from. </p>

            <p>“The streets were just filling up,” said B.N. Mishra, a local journalist, “I sat down to file an early copy with water around my ankles. I had to stop mid-way and rescue my desktop as the water rose to my shins.”</p>

            <p>Panicked residents left their homes to check on relatives and loved ones, many did not return. Devraj Yadav, a young taxi driver for instance, drove out from Araria to check on his wife’s parents who live in a village along National Highway 57. His in-laws were safe, but Yadav would never find out.</p>

            <p>“His Tata Indica was simply washed off the road,” said his neighbour Shiv Narain. “Some kids found the wreckage days later and started screaming when they realised there was a body trapped inside the car.”</p>

            <p>In all, 95 people died in Araria; a vast majority of the deaths, Amrit conceded, probably died in the first 24 hours when the district machinery was still gearing up to respond to the disaster. </p>

            <p>“Had the flood hit more flood-prone districts, casualties would have been less as people would be ready,” Amrit said, “People in Araria were not expecting water of this magnitude.”</p>

            <p>Over the next month, he said, the government fought back. The daily flood reports put out by the Bihar state disaster management agency detail impressive numbers: 1358 relief camps which sheltered 422,106 people; 1646 community kitchens which fed  another 557,719; nearly 500 boats requisitioned from the state and national disaster relief force and armed forces, and over 2000 locally made “country boats” used to evacuate 854,936 flood victims across 21 flood-hit districts.</p>

            <p>Yet many residents in Araria found issue with these numbers. Some pointed out that many residents evacuated themselves; the relief camps were actually huddled clusters of tents that people had set up themselves along the state-highways; and the relief efforts, in some cases, came too late.</p>

            <p>“By the water had left by time the NDRF came to Jogbani. The troopers said, was it place flooded at all?” said Bikram Singh, a resident, “Then we showed him the corpses we had fished out of the water, and said - here’s your flood.”</p>

            <section class="copy">
            <p>The flood warning systems of most states consist of monitoring stations along major waterways. </p>

            <p>“Most rivers have upstream dams and barrages with some storage capacity. As this storage fills, it gives a warning to those downstream,” said Himanshu Thakkar, an engineer and coordinator of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People. In year, water-levels did rise dangerously at several monitoring stations, in some cases to their highest mark in 50 years, but the rainfall arguably caused more damage.</p>

            <p>“We need to study the meteorological conditions that lead to floods like these,” said Thakkar, who first raised the possibility of floods on August 11 by analysing publicly available NASA data. “We must improve forecasting to minimise damage.”</p>

            <p>Mishra, the water expert, said the 2017 flood was only the most recent reminder that as Bihar urbanises, the state should build infrastructure that anticipates the annual flood, rather than seeks to somehow block it.</p>

            <p>At present, the state’s highways, embankments, and railway lines are built on earthworks raised tens of feet above the surrounding farmland. When the rains finally stopped,  Mishra pointed out, the floodwater was trapped between all this construction, turning low-lying areas into vast lakes spanning hundreds of hectares that took over a month to finally drain.</p>

            <p>Many cities across south-east Asia coexisted alongside their annual floods by building homes, schools, and hospitals on raised stilts, and accepting the need to move around on boats for a few months of the year. </p>

            <p>“We’ve tried the embankments. They aren’t working,” he said, “Now why not try something else?”</p>
